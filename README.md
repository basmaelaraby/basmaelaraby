# Hello! I'm Basma 👋🏼👒
I’m an aspiring UX Designer and Fashion-Tech Creative Technologist passionate about exploring how design and AI can connect people to style. I’ve always been drawn to art, fashion, and problem-solving, and I love blending creativity with technology.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, and since then, I’ve been exploring how to integrate my technical background with my creative interests.

This GitHub is a reflection of my growth journey — a space where I learn, build, and create! 🤗

### My Current Focus and Upcoming Projects
- Building an AI Style Curator app  
- Designing an Apple × Hermès digital experience  
- Exploring AR fashion through Vision Pro
